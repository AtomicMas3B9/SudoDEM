#installation of BOOST
1) full LIBRARY
./bootstrap.sh --prefix=$PWD/../boostinstall --with-libraries=python,thread,filesystem,iostreams,regex,serialization,system,date_time
2) keep sublibraries
compiling bcp to extract the sublibraries
./bootstrap.sh
./b2 tools/bcp
add the path of binary bcp to PATH
then extract the sublibraries
bcp build predef python thread filesystem iostreams regex serialization system date_time ../boost #../boost is the directory for the extracted sublibraries
#compile the sublibraries then.

Here are some commands for compiling:
#cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/nfs/stak/students/z/zhaoshi/Downloads/install /nfs/stak/students/z/zhaoshi/Downloads/trunk-1.11.1 -DINSTALL_PREFIX=/nfs/stak/students/z/zhaoshi/Downloads/install
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/nfs/stak/students/z/zhaoshi/Downloads/yadeinstall /nfs/stak/students/z/zhaoshi/Documents/myYADE -DINSTALL_PREFIX=/nfs/stak/students/z/zhaoshi/Downloads/yadeinstall
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../../DEMinstall ../SudoDEM -DINSTALL_PREFIX=../../DEMinstall
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../SudoDEMgitinstall ../SudoDEMgit -DINSTALL_PREFIX=../SudoDEMgitinstall
cmake ../SudoDEMgit

make install


The packages need installing including:
1.Eigen
2.libQGLViewer
3.loki
4.minieigen
5.PyQT4
6.PyQt4-devel
7.python-xlib
8.tkinter
9.new version Boost(1.59)
Some MEMO when installing these above packages:
Prior to starting:
1.Modify CMakeList.txt.
	set(Python_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS 2.6)--specifying the exact vertion of python to find its corresponding libs.
	ENABLE_GTS -->OFF
	ENABLE_CGAL -->OFF
	ENABLE_GL2PS OFF
	Eigen3 founding just remains INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES($(EIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIR)) and VECTORIZE part, and comment the rest part.
2.Create a file named .cshrc at home directory due to the tcsh terminal.
	Add the full paths of python packages and others (e.g., yade installation directory, and bin includes pyrcc4 etc.) to PATH.
Here we go:
1.Eigen-3.2.3
	1)Change CMakeList.txt and FindEigen3.cmake. We should specify the exact directory of Eigen3. Caution: using the absolute path.
2.libQGLViewer-2.6.3
	1)The version may be higher than that used in YADE. So some cautions need paying attention.
	Under the directory qt4 of YADE:
	2) "qreal" (data type, double) has been introduced in the new version. The codes in the direction of GUI of YADE should be changed.
	We added a head file "qglobal.h" in GLViewer.hpp, meanwhile, we replaced "float" with "qreal".
	In GLViewer.hpp, the three headfiles (qglviewer.h, manipulatedFrame.h and constraint.h) should be specified with the full paths.
	A compilation error may occor if we did not delete "virtual" ahead "ZNear()" at Line 156 in GLViewer.hpp.
	Generate img_rc.py and ui_controller.py using commands pyrcc4 and pyuic4, respectively (see the Makefile in gui under build. I do not
	know why the two commands aren't be executed when building.). Note: pyrcc4 and pyuic4 are included in PyQt4-devel. Copy both files into build after generated.


	Under the directory QGLViewer of libQGLViewer:
	Replace "qreal" with "float" ahead zNear() at Line 231 in camera.h.

3.loki-0.1.7
	Modify FindLoki.cmake under cmake. Specify the full path of LOKI_INCLUDE_DIR and LOKI_LIBRARY.

4.minieigen-0.5.3
	Modify setup.py with the full path of Eigen3 used.
	Excute the command python install setup.py --user, thereby installing into user's home.

5.PYQt4, PyQt4-devel, python-xlib, and tkinter
  These packages are installed by extracting their RPMs then put the files into the right places.
