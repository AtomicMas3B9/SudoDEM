SudoDEM: A Discrete Element Code for Non-spherical Particles

SudoDEM is specifically designed for modeling non-spherical 
particles using discrete element method (DEM), which inherits 
a basic framework of an open-source DEM code, YADE (yade-dem.org).
The project aims to develop a robust 2/3D DEM code for convex particles, 
 e.g., polyhedrons, super-ellipsoids, poly-superellipsoids, 
 cylinders and cones. The concave shapes can be constructed 
 by grouping the convex ones with the typical "clump" technique.
